# LEOtracker

Tracks low earth orbit satellites, most of the files are an android app, whilst the arduinio.ino runs on the arduino to interface with the RAMPS shield and ultimately the mechanics. The piScript.py is used to wirelessly interface with the phone and the arduino, acts a step. Works best if run as a startup script.

Still missing the ability to pull and interpret satellite data, but thats just a small patch for someone a bit better at math than us.
